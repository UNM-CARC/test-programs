STEPS
1. Relax the system to a converged geometry (ISIF=3 or ISIF=2)
2. cp CONTCAR to POSCAR and perform static calculation i.e. NO optimization (NSW=0, IBRION=-1, delete ISIF) and use the follow tag 
   LAECHG=.TRUE.
3. Sum the output charge files AECCAR0 AECCAR2 using the the chgsum.pl script. Output the sum to CHGCAR_sum file:
    ./chgsum.pl AECCAR0 AECCAR2 
4. Run the Bader charge analysis to CHGCAR output from step#3.
   ./bader CHGCAR -ref CHGCAR_sum

Charges will be in the file AFC.dat

For steps 3 you will need script chgsum.pl (in this folder)

For step 4 you will need "bader" binary from this page:
