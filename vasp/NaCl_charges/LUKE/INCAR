ISTART=0 ! calculation from beginning
ICHARG = 2 ! charge from atoms

Conected with electronic energy and SCF loop

ISMEAR = -5 ! determines how the partial occupancies are set for each wavefunction - depends on type of material' 
ISPIN = 2 ! electron can be upaired
NELM = 100 ! max steps in electronic loop
LORBIT = 11 ! writes DOSCAR and lm-decomposed PROCAR 
ALGO = Fast    ! alghoritm for solving electronic Sch.eq.
EDIFF = 0.0001 ! convergence criteria
ENCUT =550 ! specifies the cutoff energy for the plane-wave-basis set in eV
PREC = Accurate ! Increases ENCUT and number of grid points in the FFT-grid 

Connected with geometry optimization i.e. moving of atoms

IBRION = 2 ! determines how the ions are updated and move
NSW = 100 ! number of optimization cycles

outputs
LWAVE =.False.
LAECHG=.TRUE.
