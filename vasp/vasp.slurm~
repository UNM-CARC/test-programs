# Tell mpi how many MPI tasks to run. Parallelization can be done in various ways with vasp. 
# Here we have one MPI task per node and instruct VASP to spawn 64 processes in the incar file.
# We could also, for example, have twice the number of MPI tasks and halve the number of processes specified
# in the incar file. Which is faster depends on the node archetecture and requires experimentation.
